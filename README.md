# EngineeringProject

Using Mage for orchestration in combination with GCP, Docker, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Terraform, Spark, and Kafka offers a robust tech stack for building data pipelines and processing workflows. Here's a high-level overview of how you might approach this project:

Setting up GCP Environment:

Provision necessary resources on Google Cloud Platform using Terraform. This could include VM instances for running Docker containers, networking configurations, storage buckets, etc.
Ensure proper access controls and security configurations are in place.
Containerization with Docker:

Containerize PostgreSQL and pgAdmin using Docker. This allows you to easily manage and deploy these components as isolated containers.
Configure Docker networking to ensure communication between containers and with other services.
Data Extraction from Website:

Use pgAdmin or other tools to extract data from the website (NY taxis dataset) and ingest it into PostgreSQL.
Set up scheduled tasks or scripts to automate data extraction and ingestion processes.
Mage Orchestration:

Define data pipelines and processing workflows using Mage. This involves specifying tasks, dependencies, and scheduling.
Integrate Mage with GCP services for seamless orchestration and management of resources.
Batch Processing with Spark:

Develop batch processing jobs using Spark to analyze and process large volumes of data from PostgreSQL.
Utilize Spark's capabilities for data transformation, cleansing, aggregation, and analysis.
Streaming Processing with Kafka:

Set up Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing.
Implement Kafka producers to publish data changes from PostgreSQL to Kafka topics.
Develop Kafka consumers to consume data streams and perform real-time analytics or other actions.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track pipeline performance, resource utilization, and any errors or issues.
Utilize GCP's monitoring and logging services or integrate third-party tools as needed.
Testing and Optimization:

Test the entire solution for functionality, scalability, and performance under different conditions.
Optimize configurations, code, and infrastructure to improve efficiency and reliability.
