# Project Title: Data Orchestration with Mage on Google Cloud Platform

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a data orchestration solution using Mage, a modern replacement for Apache Airflow, on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The goal is to integrate and synchronize data from 3rd party sources, build real-time and batch pipelines for data transformation, and orchestrate thousands of pipelines efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Mage**: Used for workflow orchestration, task scheduling, and monitoring.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Cloud infrastructure for hosting services and resources.
- **Docker**: Containerization for PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing extracted data.
- **pgAdmin**: Tool for data extraction from a website (NY taxis dataset).
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for provisioning GCP resources.
- **Apache Spark**: Batch processing for data analysis and transformation.
- **Kafka**: Streaming platform for real-time data processing.
- **Markdown**: For documenting the project in this README.

## Project Structure

### 1. Setup GCP Environment
- Utilize Terraform to provision VM instances, networking configurations, and storage buckets on GCP.
- Ensure proper security configurations and access controls are in place.

### 2. Containerization with Docker
- Containerize PostgreSQL and pgAdmin using Docker for easy management and deployment.
- Configure Docker networking for communication between containers and other services.

### 3. Data Extraction from Website
- Use pgAdmin or similar tools to extract data from the NY taxis dataset website.
- Ingest the extracted data into PostgreSQL for further processing.

### 4. Mage Orchestration
- Define data pipelines and workflows using Mage for orchestration.
- Specify tasks, dependencies, and scheduling for seamless execution.

### 5. Batch Processing with Spark
- Develop batch processing jobs using Apache Spark to analyze and transform data from PostgreSQL.
- Utilize Spark's capabilities for data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis.

### 6. Streaming Processing with Kafka
- Set up Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing.
- Implement Kafka producers to publish data changes from PostgreSQL to Kafka topics.
- Develop Kafka consumers to consume data streams and perform real-time analytics.

### 7. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track pipeline performance and detect errors.
- Utilize GCP's monitoring and logging services or integrate third-party tools as needed.

### 8. Testing and Optimization
- Test the entire solution for functionality, scalability, and performance.
- Optimize configurations, code, and infrastructure for improved efficiency and reliability.
